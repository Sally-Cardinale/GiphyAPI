This app has pre-selected buttons related to classic romantic comedies.
When each button is clicked, ten giphy images are created related to that movie.
When each giphy is clicked it goes from still to animated/moving. When it is clicked again the animation stops.
Each giphy also provides the rating associated with it. 
When a new movie is added into the search field and the submit button is pushed a new button is added to the original buttons.
When the new movie is clicked it will create giphys the that operate the same as the preselected buttons.
